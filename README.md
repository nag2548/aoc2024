# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repository contains my solutions to the challenges in this year's
Advent of Code event. I'm using **Java 21** and **Maven** for building the project, with JUnit and AssertJ for testing.

## 🔧 Setup

To get started with the project, you’ll need to have **Java 21** and **Maven** installed on your machine. Once you’ve
cloned the repository, you can compile and run the project with the following commands:

```bash
# Compile the project
mvn clean install

# Run the tests
mvn test
```

## ❄️ Happy Coding!

Wishing you a code-filled December and a merry holiday season! 🎄
